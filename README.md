# OnboardEase
A chatbot that retrieves company-specific information such as policies, procedures, team structures, and project details to answer questions new employees might have. It can also offer personalized guidance based on their role or department.

# Problem Solved 
New employees often face challenges navigating company policies, understanding role expectations, and adapting to the work environment. The chatbot solves this by:
- Providing instant, accurate responses to common onboarding questions (e.g., “Where can I find the leave policy?” or “Who do I report to for X task?”).
- Personalizing the experience by retrieving role-specific or department-related information.
- Reducing the burden on HR staff and managers by automating many aspects of onboarding.
